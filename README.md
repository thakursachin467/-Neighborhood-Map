## Project Overview

we developed a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. we will  added functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party(foursqaure) data about those locations and various ways to browse the content

## Why this Project?

The neighborhood map application is complex enough and incorporates a variety of data points that it can easily become unwieldy to manage. There are a number of frameworks, libraries and APIs available to make this process more manageable and many employers are looking for specific skills in using these packages.

## What will I Learn?

I learned how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. I explored how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities  to use. Finally, I implemented third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of your application.
